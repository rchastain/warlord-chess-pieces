# Warlord Chess Pieces

Chess pieces of the [Warlord](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Warlord) chess program by William H. Rogers.

The chess pieces are stored in the file *warlord.txt*.

The repository includes a Lazarus project for converting the text file to a bitmap.

There is another Lazarus project for cutting the bitmap into individual images.
